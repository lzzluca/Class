* Description:
A "Class" function to define "classes" in Javascript: a really light clone of the famous MooTools Class function.

* Goals:
- Encourage objective Javascript instead of sequential programming (!)
- MooTools syntax compatibility (means be allowed to move the code on MooTools or project like moo4q in the future)
- Get an unique class-pattern (avoiding mixed code like using prototype and closures patterns togheter)
- Moving the focus from the function to the prototype, for the functions constructor modelling
- Get lighter classes by provides tools for code reusing
- Class powered by really light code, easy to be mantained by me (or you!)
- Basic functionalities from MooTools: extend, implement, parent method, the function “initialize” as constructor (and as minor: setOptions)

The Class declaration syntax is compatible with the MooTools one: that allows you to move your code on MooTools or on project like "moo4q" (http://moo4q.com/) .

* How to build it:
The Makefile is in the folder "src"; just run it after every changes. The Makefile builds all the modules in one file: "class-min.js". That is the file to include in your pages.
The Makefile looks for the Google's Closure Compiler: https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/
Change the var COMPILER with the path of your jar in the Makefile.

I wrote it in my current company, WCN (wcn.co.uk), and i was allowed to release it as open source. Thanks (particularly to Jack Hobson)!
