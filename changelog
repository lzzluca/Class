1.1:
  Removed the folder demo: i think it was useless, a good tutorial is here:
    http://nerdstuckathome.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/a-class-function-to-define-classes-in-javascript-with-mootools-like-syntax/
    also the fresh added tests are a tutorial themself
  Merged the folder src-dev and src-min in the src one, for convenience using make
  Added tests: there is the new folder test/ (with the test sources) and the file SpecRunner.html to run them. They are designed to be runned by Jasmine, included in lib/ .
  Added this file (changelog)
  Added a change (as fix) on the file src/Extend.js: now, extending a class, only the functions that are defined on both sub and super, are wrapped on the sub (to allow the use of this.parent). I assume that
    is the dafault MooTools's behaviour but more checks will follow.
  Added few changes at the Makefile, to make it fitting the new filesystem structure; added also the labels "build", "clean" and "all" for convenience (run just "make" is enough to build, by the way...)
  Updated the README with the new version and some changes

29/11/2013: I HAD TO RESET THE GIT HISTORY: I DON'T KNOW HOW, I MANAGED TO BREAK THE MASTER HISTORY.
